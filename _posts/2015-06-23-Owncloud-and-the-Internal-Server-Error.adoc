= Owncloud and the Internal Server Error 

Recently I installed owncloud (8.0.3) on a raspberry pi2 (wheezy) and it worked like a charm. However, after restarting the apache I received a Internal Server Error that prevented the login.

Examination of the owncloud.log located in the data directory of owncloud revealed:

{"reqId":"asd6a7sd8asd6a5a78sd98ad6a9a", "remoteAddr":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", "app":"remote", "message":"An exception occurred while executing 'UPDATE `oc_preferences` SET `configvalue` = ? WHERE `userid` = ? AND `appid` = ? AND `configkey` = ? ' with params [1435094587, \"xxx\", \"login\", \"lastLogin\"]:\n\nSQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1665 Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.","level":4,"time":"2015-06-23T21:23:07+00:00"}

Apparently this results from a mismatch in the logging of the binary format from owncloud and the database. Changing of BINLOG_FORMAT=MIXED in the database does the trick:  

mysql -u username -p -h host databasename

SET GLOBAL binlog_format=MIXED;
